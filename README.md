# 🩺 ArogyaBridge — Decentralized Electronic Health Record (EHR) System

> **Built with MERN Stack + Blockchain + IPFS + AI Chatbot**  
> Bridging the gap between secure medical data, transparency, and control for patients, doctors, and labs.

<br>

## 🚀 Project Overview

**ArogyaBridge** is a blockchain-powered platform that enables secure, tamper-proof, and decentralized storage of medical records. It empowers **patients** with ownership and control over their health data, while providing **doctors** and **diagnostic centers** seamless yet permissioned access. The system ensures **trust, traceability, and transparency** — eliminating the risks of centralized failures, data leaks, and fake reports.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Health records are fragmented across hospitals with **no unified view**.
- **Patients lack control** over who can access their sensitive data.
- **Medical reports and prescriptions can be faked**.
- **Insurance approvals are delayed** due to manual verification.
- Lack of **audit logs** and **transparent access history**.

## 💡 Our Solution

A decentralized Electronic Health Record system with:

- **Ethereum blockchain** for tamper-proof access control.
- **IPFS** for decentralized file storage.
- **MetaMask** for secure login and transaction signing.
- **Smart contracts** to manage access permissions.
- **AI Chatbot** to answer patient queries and FAQs.
- **Role-based functionality** for Patients, Doctors, and Labs.
- **MongoDB** to store user metadata and analytics.
- **MVC architecture** for clean backend organization.
